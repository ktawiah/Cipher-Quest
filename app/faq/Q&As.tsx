    question: "What is the Caesars cipher?",
    answer:
      "The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques of cryptography, based on a mono-alphabetic cipher. It is a kind of replacement (substitution) cipher, where all letter are shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabets.",

    question: "When was Caesars cipher invented?",
    answer:
      "Caesar cipher was invented in 100 BCE by Gaus Julius Caesar, the earliest known figure with testimonies such as Suetonius' accounts, suggesting his use of this substitution technique to safeguard military communications. However, the exact date of creation and its real author are unknown.",

    question: "How does the Caesars cipher algorithm work?",
    answer:
      "The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D,' 'B' becomes 'E,' and so on. The same shift is applied in decryption to recover the original message.",

    question: "How can a caesars cipher text??",
    answer:
      "A message encoded with the Caesar cipher has a shift in its frequency analysis diagram (equal to the selected shift) and a coincidence index similar to the one of the plain text. Any reference to Caesar, emperor of Rome, or more generally to antiquity and the Roman Empire are clues.",
