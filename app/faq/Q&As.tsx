    question: "What is the Caesars cipher?",
    answer:
      "The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques of cryptography, based on a mono-alphabetic cipher. It is a kind of replacement (substitution) cipher, where all letter are shifted a certain number of positions down the alphabets.",
  },

    question: "Who invented Caesar Cipher?",
    answer:
      "Caesar Cipher was invented by  Gaus Julius Caesar. It was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his generals in the field. In the event that one of his messages got intercepted, his opponent could not read them.",
  },

    key: 3,
    question: "When was Caesars cipher invented?",
    answer:
      "The Caesar Cipher is believed to have been invented around 100 BC. The earliest known figure with testimonies such as Suetonius' accounts suggest its use in substitution technique to safeguard military communications. However, the exact date of creation and its real author are unknown.",

    key: 4,
    question: "How does the Caesars cipher algorithm work?",
    answer:
      "The Caesar cipher works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D,' 'B' becomes 'E,' and so on. The same shift is applied in decryption to recover the original message.",

    question: "How can a caesars cipher text??",
    answer:
      "A message encoded with the Caesar cipher has a shift in its frequency analysis diagram (equal to the selected shift) and a coincidence index similar to the one of the plain text. Any reference to Caesar, emperor of Rome, or more generally to antiquity and the Roman Empire are clues.",
  },

    key: 6,
    question: "What is the significance of Caesars Cipher in the modern world?",
    answer:
      "The significance of Caesar Cipher lies in its historical value and the massive role it plays in introducing the concept of encryption. It helped lay the foundation for more complex and secure encryption methods that are widely used today",
